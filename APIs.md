### Move
This is the movement API. This is used in most turtle scripts.

- `u(x)` - Move up x blocks
- `d(x)` - Move down x blocks
- `t(x)` - Turn. 1 = Left, 2 = Right, 3 = 180deg
- `b(x)` - Move back x blocks and end up facing your original direction.
- `r(x)` - Move right x blocks and end up facing your original direction.
- `l(x)` - Move left x blocks and end up facing your original direction.
- `floor()` - Move down to the floor.
- `dump(d)` - Dump all cargo. d = direction to dump (`"up"`, `"down"` or blank (`""`)).
