# Turtles
- Place the turtle down.
- `label set <labelName>`
- Dye the turtle.
- Use pastebin to get the `github.lua` script.
```
pastebin get xxxxxx github
```
- Use the `github.lua` script to pull down whatever scripts you need.
```
github get samuelbeard/cc/master/turtle/lumberjack.lua lumberjack
```

> Why use Pastbin for just one script?
>> The scripts will be updated frequently. So it is best to always pull the latest version from GitHub instead of old versions from Pastebin.
