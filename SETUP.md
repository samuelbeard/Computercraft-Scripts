# Turtles
- Place the turtle down.
- `label set <labelName>`
- Dye the turtle.
- Use pastebin to get the `github.lua` script.
```
pastebin get 5CykJbA5 github
```

If this link no longer works, set up a new pastebin with the code from `github.lua`.

- Run the setup
```
github get setup.lua setup
setup
```

This will install all of the currently working scripts.

> Why use Pastbin for just one script?
>> The scripts will be updated frequently. So it is best to always pull the latest version from GitHub instead of old versions from Pastebin.
